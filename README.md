# Visa-benefits

The task: to solve the problem of finding privileges for Visa Signature and Visa Infinite cards, which we receive by email from our managers and are not published at visa.com.ru. Sometimes the search for emails took a very long time and the customers on the call were not satisfied.

Solution: I decided to make a simple CRUD application that takes the name of the privilege, description and packs it into a details tag.  I also implemented the TinyMCE library to format the text, which increased readability. 

The technologies that I used: MongoDB, JSX, CSS, Azure services, JavaScript, Node, Express.
